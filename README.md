The Problem: TFSAs vs RRSPs

The goal of this test is to create a financial calculator that compares using a TFSA (tax-free savings account) and RRSP (registered retirement savings plan) to save money.

RRSPs allow Canadians to defer paying taxes until they withdraw money from their account. In practice Canadians get a tax refund on the money they deposited into RSP. A TFSA, on the other hand, allows Canadians to save their after tax money in a way that the future growth (interest earned) remains tax-free forever so all future withdrawals are not taxed.

**This calculator will require the following input fields**

- **Current Marginal Tax Rate** - This is the highest income tax bracket of the “user”
- **Average Tax Rate in Retirement** - This is the average income tax the “user” pays in retirement
- **Amount of Deposit** - The amount of money being deposited in the comparison
- **Years Invested** - The number of years before this money is withdrawn again
- **Return on Investment** - Rate at which the invested money grows each year
- **Inflation Rate** - Expected rate of inflation each year (used to calculate the real rate of return)

**It should produce the following results**

- Amount of after-tax deposited in the TFSA vs RRSP (i.e., the RRSP deposit amount should be equivalent to the TFSA deposit in after-tax dollars, which should be larger considering that RRSP deposits are made tax-free)
- The future value (in [today](http://airmail.calendar/2016-07-29%2012:00:00%20PDT)’s dollars) of the savings at the end of the investment period
- The tax paid upon withdrawal (only applies to money saved in theRRSP)
- The after-tax future value of the investment at the end of the investment period
